# Release Notes

## v2.4.0 (Multi-Provider OpenWiki, RepoGraph Code Health & Creator Decoupling)
- **Multi-Provider LLM Engine for OpenWiki**: Decoupled `openwiki_daemon.py` from single-provider constraints. Fully supports Google Gemma 4 (`gemma-4-12b-it` via `google-genai`), Groq (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`), Grok/xAI (`grok-2-latest`), Nvidia NIM (`meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`), OpenRouter (`anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`), OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`), Ollama (`llama3`), LM Studio, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints via environment variables.
- **RepoGraph Deterministic Code Health Engine**: Introduced zero-token, zero-inference local Git analytics in OpenWiki. Computes 90-day hotspot velocity, maintainability index, commit distribution, and single-author bus factor risk scoring without external API calls.
- **Interactive Code Health Dashboard (`code_health_dashboard.html`)**: Added a Repowise-grade visual dashboard in `.openwiki/` featuring 6 SVG visual panels (Galaxy Cluster Map, Defect Risk Donut, Bus Factor Matrix, Commit Velocity Churn, Hotspot Leaderboard, Architecture Radar), 60-second live auto-refresh, and real-time memB ADR synchronization.
- **MCP Installer Sanitization**: Enhanced `installer.js` directory scanning to filter out dotfiles, `.DS_Store`, and `__pycache__` artifacts during interactive and automated MCP setup.

## v2.3.0 (Ecosystem Phase 4)
- **Agentic Ingestion**: Discarded dumb crawling. `memb_ingest.py` is now explicitly driven by LLMs via `--project` and `--category` flags, ensuring highly semantic, intelligent physical categorization.
- **Auto-Pruning Vault**: The AI-first Vault (`God_Mode.md`) is now perfectly self-pruning and strictly sanitizes filenames for Obsidian WikiLink compatibility.
- **Loose Coupling Fusion (memB + OpenWiki)**: Implemented cross-skill synergistic triggers. OpenWiki can now autonomously trigger memB ingestion via silent background CLI handoffs.
- **Global AI-First Directives**: Deployed strict navigation directives to `memb-skill`, forcing all agents (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude) to read `God_Mode.md` instead of blindly scanning files.

## v2.2.1
- **memB Core Architecture Update**: `memb_ingest.py` now natively generates an AI-first flat-file markdown vault (Top-Down Radial God Mode Topology) to allow native zero-compute context navigation for local 30MB SLMs.
- Replaced `_CLAUDE.md` with a universal `agent.md` operating manual for the vector engine in the vault.

## v2.2.0
- Relicensed project under Apache 2.0 Licensing.
- Added **memB Deep Ingestion Tool** (`memb_ingest.py`) and new `/memb-ingest` skill.
- Created native **Obsidian Vault Plugin** for memB synchronization and removed static obsidian scripts.
- Added Obsidian Vault exporter and Mermaid knowledge graph visualizer tool (with radial mindmap layout).
- Implemented a non-blocking auto-update checker for npm releases.
- Added new `/bdbmediastorm` skill and updated `/bdbrainstorm` scaffolding rules.
- Added new `github-repo` skill for repository standards.
- Added trilingual README support (English, German, Portuguese) with 1:1 complete section parity.
- Synced latest BDB MCP token-saver processors.

## v2.1.0
- Split package into `-pro` (with OpenWiki and memB background daemons) and `@legacy` tags on NPM.
- Rewrote the OpenWiki daemon to use direct Gemma 4 API calls, fixing infinite recursion bugs and `agy` agent spawning issues.
- Updated the CLI installer with an interactive colored menu for MCP selection.
- Automated daemon deployment and `.env` credentials storage via the installer.

## v2.0.0
- Refined skill selection down to 143 highly optimized skills.
- Integrated OpenWiki documentation support.
- Cleaned up PII and added strict privacy guidelines.
